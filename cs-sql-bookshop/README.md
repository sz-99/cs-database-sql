# SQL Bookshop

Instructions for this sprint can be found at: [SQL Bookshop](https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/cs-back-end/cs-databases-intro)

## Powershell Script

To use the convenient Powershell script:

1. Enter your **server name**, **username** and **password** in the script, and save changes.
2. Run the script from the root folder, like this:

```bash
# In the root folder
.\RunAll.ps1
```

The generated `00_test.txt` file should contain a success message. If not, then the server name, username or password are likely not correct. (Don't forget to check SQL Server Express service is running, too!)

Each file depends on the next, so most text outputs will contain errors - as you work through the sprint these files will regenerate. Eventually all should contain the correct output for their task.
